At the [Institute of Macroeconomic and Policy Analysis](https://impa.american.edu/) ("IMPA"), I work on building and extending the IMPA computational model, and using the model to evaluate policy proposals.

I'll share more details here shortly, but in the meantime, you can read more about the IMPA model [here](https://impa.american.edu/impa-model/)!
