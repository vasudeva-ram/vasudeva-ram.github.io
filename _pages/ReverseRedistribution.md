<b>Overview:</b> 
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
This policy brief evaluates the macroeconomic and distributional impacts of the final version of the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB), which closely mirrors the Senate bill. Like earlier versions, it preserves key 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions, prioritizing high-income tax cuts despite limited fiscal space. The final law is broadly “macro neutral,” with a projected GDP decline of 0.08% in 2034 compared to 0.66% under the House bill, but it adds about $421 billion to the deficit over 2025–2034. Making business tax provisions permanent does little to boost growth, leaving federal revenues roughly 7.5% lower in ten years and pushing cumulative deficits to nearly $3.4 trillion. These tax cuts are financed partly through deeper Medicaid reductions, heightening fiscal and economic risks. The distributional effects remain regressive, with gains concentrated among the top 10% and larger losses for the bottom 10% due to Medicaid cuts and less generous temporary relief.
