I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Institute for Macroeconomic and Policy Analysis](https://impa.american.edu/), working on monetary and fiscal policy. I am particularly interested in inequality and how policy changes affect the distribution of income and wealth across the economy. 

I graduated from American University in 2023 with a PhD in Economics, and am on the job market over the 2024-25 season.
