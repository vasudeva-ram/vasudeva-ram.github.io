I am a quantitative macroeconomist with research interests in macroeconomic policy and household inequality. I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Institute for Macroeconomic and Policy Analysis](https://impa.american.edu/) and currently on the 2024-2025 Economics Job Market. 

My research primarily explores the channels through which monetary and fiscal policies influence the distribution of income and wealth across the economy. You can find more information on my research in my [research statement](/assets/pdf/ResearchStatement.pdf).
