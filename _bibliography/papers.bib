  abstract={This paper analyses the role of capacity constraints and endogenous capacity utilization within a New Keynesian framework. In our model, firms set their capacity under demand uncertainty, utilizing both an effort margin and subsequent capacity expansion to meet demand. A distinguishing feature of the model is that the responses of productivity, markups, labor share, and inflation are state-dependent. The model provides three main insights. First, markups can be procyclical in response to expansionary demand shocks. This occurs because firms face a high probability of being capacity constrained, countering the conventional impact of nominal rigidities. Second, the labor share can be counter-cyclical for empirically consistent reasons, i.e., when labor productivity rises faster than real wages. Third, both the response and composition of inflation depend crucially on the degree of capacity utilization: under normal conditions, inflation exhibits a hump-shaped response as procyclical productivity mitigates upward pressure on prices early in the cycle. However, in times of excessive capacity utilization, inflation responds on impact, is primarily driven by markups, and can even prompt a counter-cyclical response of real wages. Using Bayesian IRF-matching, we illustrate that our model offers a highly plausible fit to the data. Crucially, the results support a procyclical markup and counter-cyclical labor share in line with recent evidence, while effectively capturing the pronounced procyclicality of capacity utilization observed in the manufacturing sector.},

  title={The Huey Long Spending Program in Louisiana: Estimating Fiscal Multipliers during the Great Depression},
  author={Mathy, Gabriel and Ramaswamy, Vasudeva},
  year={2024},
  journal={Working Paper},
  institution={American University},
  abstract={What was the economic impact of expansionary fiscal policy during the Great Depression? We revisit this classic question using a unique state-level spending program to shed new light on the subject. Louisiana Governor Huey Long embarked on an ambitious public works and educational spending program on the eve of the Great Depression. We use the variation in state- and parish-level spending prevailing in the economy over the 1930s to estimate fiscal multipliers in the Great Depression. We find a multiplier of roughly 1 for the entire 1929-1939 period and about 1.25 for the 1929-1933 period. These estimates are similar to other studies in the Great Depression like Fishback and Kachanovskaya (2015), but lower than some modern studies at the zero lower bound that estimate the multiplier to be closer to 1.7-1.8 (Chodorow-Reich, 2019). We discuss factors that could explain the lower multipliers amidst record economic slack including a high share of imports, low level of human capital, small domestic production capacity, and corruption. We propose a corruption dismultiplier where corruption results in a lower fiscal multiplier due to measurement error. We use the records of indictments for corruption in the 1939-1940 Louisiana Scandals to try to correct for this error and find larger multipliers if we assume skimming of â‰ˆ2%.},

  title={Rule-based Trading on an Order-driven Exchange: A Reassessment},
  author={Isaac, Alan G and Ramaswamy, Vasudeva},
  journal={Quantitative Finance},
  pages={1--16},
  year={2023},
  abstract={A core research area of computational behavioral finance investigates emergent price dynamics when heterogeneous traders follow a mix of rule-based strategies and interact indirectly through a limit order book. This paper offers a detailed specification of such a model in order to raise questions about some previous findings. The questions force a comprehensive reconsideration of the price dynamics of a well-known model. This leads to a surprising clarification of the contributions of various trading strategies to market outcomes: a popular characterization of chartism proves largely irrelevant for price dynamics. We also shed new light on the volume-volatility relationship, and provide improved visualizations to expose market behavior.},
