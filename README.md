# Vasudeva Ramaswamy's Personal Website

This repository contains the source code and other materials related to my personal website, [vasudeva-ram.github.io](vasudeva-ram.github.io).
The site is based on the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) theme, which is a "simple, clean, and responsive [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme for academics."

The ```assets``` folder contains the PDFs and images found on this website, including working papers and published material.
